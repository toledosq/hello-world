Practice repository

This is just a practice repository. I'm learning how to use github. 

As of today, December 8, 2016, I am experienced in Python, Java, C, C++, and SQL.
I'm currently learning:
Bash scripts
Linux
Linux terminal
Unix basics
Git
Virtual Machines
REST
SSH and putty

This will be fun to look back on in 5 years.
